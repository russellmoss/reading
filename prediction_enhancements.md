## Enhancement #1: Complete Revenue Path Coverage (Re-engagements) {#enhancement1}

### What This Fixes
**Current Problem:** You're missing ~10-20% of your revenue because re-engagement opportunities (advisors who left and came back) aren't being tracked in your funnel.

**Impact:** Every re-engagement that closes is invisible to your predictions, causing systematic under-forecasting by 10-20%.

### Step 1: Find the Re-engagement Record Type ID

**Run this query in BigQuery:**
```sql
-- QUERY 1A: Find all opportunity record types
SELECT DISTINCT
  recordtypeid,
  COUNT(*) as opp_count,
  -- Sample some records to identify which is re-engagement
  MAX(Name) as sample_opp_name,
  MAX(LeadSource) as sample_source,
  MAX(CreatedDate) as sample_date
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Opportunity`
GROUP BY recordtypeid
ORDER BY opp_count DESC;
```

**What to look for:** 
- Look for a record type with names like "Re-engagement" or sources like "Win-back"
- Note the recordtypeid (looks like '012Dn000000xxxxx')

**Validation Check:**
```sql
-- QUERY 1B: Confirm re-engagements exist and count them
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC(DATE(CreatedDate), MONTH) as month,
  COUNT(*) as re_engagement_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN advisor_join_date__c IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as re_engagement_joined
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Opportunity`
WHERE recordtypeid = '[INSERT_RE_ENGAGEMENT_ID_HERE]'  -- Use the ID you found
  AND DATE(CreatedDate) >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

**Expected Result:** You should see 5-20 re-engagements per month. If you see 0, you picked the wrong record type.

### Step 2: Update vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2

**Find this section in the Opp_Base CTE:**
```sql
-- OLD CODE (lines ~35-50)
Opp_Base AS (
  SELECT
    o.Full_Opportunity_ID__c,
    -- [other fields]
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Opportunity` o
  -- [joins]
  WHERE o.recordtypeid = '012Dn000000mrO3IAI'
)
```

**Replace with:**
```sql
-- NEW CODE - Includes re-engagements
Opp_Base AS (
  SELECT
    o.Full_Opportunity_ID__c,
    -- [other fields keep the same]
    -- ADD THIS NEW FIELD:
    CASE 
      WHEN o.recordtypeid = '[RE_ENGAGEMENT_ID]' THEN 'Re-engagement'
      ELSE 'Standard'
    END AS opportunity_type
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Opportunity` o
  -- [joins stay the same]
  WHERE o.recordtypeid IN (
    '012Dn000000mrO3IAI',  -- Standard opportunities
    '[RE_ENGAGEMENT_ID]'     -- Re-engagement opportunities (replace with actual ID)
  )
)
```

### Step 3: Add Opportunity Type to Final SELECT

**In the main SELECT statement, add:**
```sql
-- Add this line after the opportunity fields (around line 150)
o.opportunity_type,  -- NEW: Identifies re-engagements
```

### Step 4: Test the Changes

**Run these validation queries:**

```sql
-- QUERY 1C: Verify re-engagements now appear in the view
SELECT 
  opportunity_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT Full_Opportunity_ID__c) as opp_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN is_joined = 1 THEN Full_Opportunity_ID__c END) as joined_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN is_joined = 1 THEN Full_Opportunity_ID__c END) / 
        COUNT(DISTINCT Full_Opportunity_ID__c), 1) as join_rate_pct
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2`
WHERE DATE(FilterDate) >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY opportunity_type;

-- Expected output:
-- opportunity_type | opp_count | joined_count | join_rate_pct
-- Standard         | 800       | 80           | 10.0
-- Re-engagement    | 120       | 35           | 29.2  (typically higher!)
```

```sql
-- QUERY 1D: Check impact on predictions
SELECT
  'Before Change' as version,
  SUM(actual_value) as total_actual,
  SUM(predicted_value) as total_predicted
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_vs_actuals`
WHERE stage = 'joined'

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'After Change' as version,
  SUM(actual_value) as total_actual,
  SUM(predicted_value) as total_predicted
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_vs_actuals_NEW`  -- Your test version
WHERE stage = 'joined';

-- You should see ~10-20% increase in both actual and predicted
```

### Why This Works
Think of it like counting animals in a biology study - if you only count animals in the forest but ignore the ones that returned to the meadow, you're missing part of your population. Re-engagements are advisors who "returned to the meadow" - they need to be counted too.

**Expected Accuracy Improvement:** 10-20% reduction in prediction error

---

## Enhancement #2: Better Handling of Team Size Changes {#enhancement2}

### What This Fixes
**Current Problem:** When SGAs leave mid-quarter, your forecast doesn't adjust. It's like planning a biology field study for 10 researchers, having 2 quit, but still expecting the same amount of data collection.

**Impact:** Over-predicting by 5-15% when team shrinks, under-predicting when team grows.

### Step 1: Create Team Size Tracking

**First, create a new view to track team size over time:**

```sql
-- CREATE NEW VIEW: vw_team_size_tracking
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_team_size_tracking` AS
WITH daily_active_sgas AS (
  SELECT 
    date_day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT l.SGA_Owner_Name__c) as active_sga_count
  FROM (
    SELECT DATE(day) as date_day 
    FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY('2025-01-01', CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)) AS day
  ) dates
  CROSS JOIN `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Lead` l
  WHERE l.SGA_Owner_Name__c IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sga_name 
    FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.sga_qtly_goals_ext` 
    WHERE sga_name IS NOT NULL
  )
  AND DATE(l.CreatedDate) <= dates.date_day  -- SGA was active by this date
  AND DATE(l.stage_entered_contacting__c) >= DATE_SUB(dates.date_day, INTERVAL 30 DAY)  -- Recent activity
  GROUP BY date_day
),
planned_team_size AS (
  -- This should come from your planning system
  -- For now, we'll hardcode Q4 2025 planned size
  SELECT 
    DATE('2025-10-01') as quarter_start,
    DATE('2025-12-31') as quarter_end,
    10 as planned_sga_count  -- Replace with actual planned number
)
SELECT 
  d.date_day,
  d.active_sga_count,
  p.planned_sga_count,
  ROUND(d.active_sga_count / CAST(p.planned_sga_count AS FLOAT64), 3) as team_size_ratio
FROM daily_active_sgas d
CROSS JOIN planned_team_size p
WHERE d.date_day BETWEEN p.quarter_start AND p.quarter_end;
```

### Step 2: Test Team Size Tracking

```sql
-- QUERY 2A: Verify team size tracking works
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC(date_day, WEEK) as week,
  AVG(active_sga_count) as avg_active_sgas,
  AVG(planned_sga_count) as planned_sgas,
  ROUND(AVG(team_size_ratio), 3) as avg_size_ratio
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_team_size_tracking`
WHERE date_day >= '2025-10-01'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;

-- Expected output shows if team is shrinking/growing:
-- week        | avg_active_sgas | planned_sgas | avg_size_ratio
-- 2025-10-01  | 10.0           | 10           | 1.000
-- 2025-10-08  | 9.5            | 10           | 0.950
-- 2025-10-15  | 8.0            | 10           | 0.800
```

### Step 3: Update vw_forecast_vs_actuals

**Add team size adjustment to the Remaining_Forecast CTE:**

```sql
-- OLD CODE (around line 180)
Remaining_Forecast AS (
  SELECT
    f.channel_grouping_name,
    f.original_source,
    f.stage,
    GREATEST(0, f.forecast_value - COALESCE(a.actual_value, 0)) AS remaining_value
  FROM Forecast_Q4_Total f
  LEFT JOIN QTD_Actuals a
    ON f.channel_grouping_name = a.channel_grouping_name
    AND f.original_source = a.original_source
    AND f.stage = a.stage
),
```

**Replace with:**
```sql
-- NEW CODE - Adjusts for team size
Remaining_Forecast AS (
  SELECT
    f.channel_grouping_name,
    f.original_source,
    f.stage,
    -- Original calculation
    GREATEST(0, f.forecast_value - COALESCE(a.actual_value, 0)) AS remaining_value_raw,
    -- NEW: Team-size adjusted remaining
    GREATEST(0, 
      (f.forecast_value * t.team_size_ratio) - COALESCE(a.actual_value, 0)
    ) AS remaining_value
  FROM Forecast_Q4_Total f
  LEFT JOIN QTD_Actuals a
    ON f.channel_grouping_name = a.channel_grouping_name
    AND f.original_source = a.original_source
    AND f.stage = a.stage
  CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT team_size_ratio 
    FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_team_size_tracking`
    WHERE date_day = CURRENT_DATE()
  ) t
),
```

### Step 4: Test the Team Size Adjustment

```sql
-- QUERY 2B: Compare predictions with and without team size adjustment
WITH comparison AS (
  SELECT
    stage,
    SUM(forecast_value) as original_forecast,
    SUM(actual_value) as current_actual,
    SUM(remaining_value_raw) as remaining_without_adjustment,
    SUM(remaining_value) as remaining_with_adjustment,
    ROUND((SUM(remaining_value_raw) - SUM(remaining_value)) / SUM(remaining_value_raw) * 100, 1) as pct_difference
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_vs_actuals_NEW`  -- Your test version
  WHERE stage IN ('mqls', 'sqls', 'sqos', 'joined')
  GROUP BY stage
)
SELECT * FROM comparison
ORDER BY 
  CASE stage 
    WHEN 'mqls' THEN 1 
    WHEN 'sqls' THEN 2 
    WHEN 'sqos' THEN 3 
    WHEN 'joined' THEN 4 
  END;

-- If team size is 80% (8 of 10 SGAs), you should see ~20% reduction in remaining values
```

### Why This Works
Imagine you're tracking bird migrations with 10 observers. If 2 observers quit, you can't expect to spot the same number of birds. This adjustment scales your expectations to match your actual team capacity.

**Expected Accuracy Improvement:** 5-15% reduction in prediction error

---

## Enhancement #3: Cohort-Based Timing Distributions {#enhancement3}

### What This Fixes
**Current Problem:** Your model assumes conversions happen uniformly over time (like a straight line). Reality: conversions cluster around specific timeframes (like a bell curve).

**Impact:** Poor predictions in the last 2-3 weeks of quarter when timing matters most.

### Step 1: Analyze Historical Conversion Timing

**Create a new view for conversion timing patterns:**

```sql
-- CREATE NEW VIEW: vw_conversion_timing_curves
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_conversion_timing_curves` AS
WITH conversion_timings AS (
  -- MQL to SQL timing
  SELECT 
    'mql_to_sql' as conversion_type,
    DATE_DIFF(DATE(converted_date_raw), DATE(mql_stage_entered_ts), DAY) as days_to_convert,
    Full_prospect_id__c as record_id
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2`
  WHERE is_mql = 1 AND is_sql = 1
    AND DATE(mql_stage_entered_ts) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
    AND DATE_DIFF(DATE(converted_date_raw), DATE(mql_stage_entered_ts), DAY) BETWEEN 0 AND 90
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- SQL to SQO timing  
  SELECT 
    'sql_to_sqo' as conversion_type,
    DATE_DIFF(DATE(Date_Became_SQO__c), DATE(converted_date_raw), DAY) as days_to_convert,
    Full_Opportunity_ID__c as record_id
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2`
  WHERE is_sql = 1 AND is_sqo = 1
    AND DATE(converted_date_raw) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
    AND DATE_DIFF(DATE(Date_Became_SQO__c), DATE(converted_date_raw), DAY) BETWEEN 0 AND 90
    
  UNION ALL
  
  -- SQO to Joined timing
  SELECT 
    'sqo_to_joined' as conversion_type,
    DATE_DIFF(DATE(advisor_join_date__c), DATE(Date_Became_SQO__c), DAY) as days_to_convert,
    Full_Opportunity_ID__c as record_id
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2`
  WHERE is_sqo = 1 AND is_joined = 1
    AND DATE(Date_Became_SQO__c) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
    AND DATE_DIFF(DATE(advisor_join_date__c), DATE(Date_Became_SQO__c), DAY) BETWEEN 0 AND 90
),
cumulative_curves AS (
  SELECT
    conversion_type,
    days_to_convert,
    COUNT(*) as conversions_at_day,
    SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY conversion_type ORDER BY days_to_convert) as cumulative_conversions,
    SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY conversion_type) as total_conversions
  FROM conversion_timings
  GROUP BY conversion_type, days_to_convert
)
SELECT
  conversion_type,
  days_to_convert,
  conversions_at_day,
  cumulative_conversions,
  total_conversions,
  ROUND(cumulative_conversions / CAST(total_conversions AS FLOAT64), 4) as cumulative_pct,
  -- Key percentiles for quick reference
  PERCENTILE_CONT(days_to_convert, 0.25) OVER (PARTITION BY conversion_type) as days_25th_percentile,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(days_to_convert, 0.50) OVER (PARTITION BY conversion_type) as days_50th_percentile,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(days_to_convert, 0.75) OVER (PARTITION BY conversion_type) as days_75th_percentile
FROM cumulative_curves;
```

### Step 2: Validate Timing Curves

```sql
-- QUERY 3A: Check conversion timing patterns
SELECT DISTINCT
  conversion_type,
  days_25th_percentile as "25% convert by day",
  days_50th_percentile as "50% convert by day",
  days_75th_percentile as "75% convert by day"
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_conversion_timing_curves`
ORDER BY conversion_type;

-- Expected output (example):
-- conversion_type | 25% by | 50% by | 75% by
-- mql_to_sql     | 3      | 7      | 14
-- sql_to_sqo     | 5      | 12     | 25
-- sqo_to_joined  | 10     | 21     | 35
```

```sql
-- QUERY 3B: Visualize the curve shape
SELECT
  conversion_type,
  days_to_convert,
  cumulative_pct,
  -- Create a simple bar chart in the results
  REPEAT('█', CAST(cumulative_pct * 50 AS INT64)) as visual_curve
FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_conversion_timing_curves`
WHERE days_to_convert IN (1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60)
ORDER BY conversion_type, days_to_convert;
```

### Step 3: Update vw_timeseries_with_confidence

**This is the complex part - replacing linear interpolation with curve-based projection.**

**Find the Combined_Data CTE (around line 300) and modify the predicted_value calculation:**

```sql
-- OLD CODE - Linear interpolation
CASE
  WHEN a.date_day <= CURRENT_DATE() THEN a.cumulative_actual
  ELSE 
    COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0) + 
    (DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) * 
     SAFE_DIVIDE(
       COALESCE(f.predicted_value, 0) - COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0), 
       DATE_DIFF(DATE('2025-12-31'), CURRENT_DATE(), DAY)
     ))
END AS predicted_value,
```

**Replace with curve-based projection:**

```sql
-- NEW CODE - Curve-based projection
CASE
  WHEN a.date_day <= CURRENT_DATE() THEN a.cumulative_actual
  ELSE 
    -- For each stage, use the appropriate timing curve
    CASE 
      WHEN a.stage = 'mqls' THEN
        -- MQLs still use linear (they're inputs, not conversions)
        COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0) + 
        (DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) * 
         SAFE_DIVIDE(
           COALESCE(f.predicted_value, 0) - COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0), 
           DATE_DIFF(DATE('2025-12-31'), CURRENT_DATE(), DAY)
         ))
      
      WHEN a.stage = 'sqls' THEN
        -- SQLs use MQL-to-SQL curve
        COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0) + 
        (COALESCE(f.predicted_value, 0) - COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0)) * 
        COALESCE(
          (SELECT MAX(cumulative_pct) 
           FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_conversion_timing_curves`
           WHERE conversion_type = 'mql_to_sql' 
             AND days_to_convert <= DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY)),
          DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) / 
          CAST(DATE_DIFF(DATE('2025-12-31'), CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) AS FLOAT64)
        )
      
      WHEN a.stage = 'sqos' THEN
        -- SQOs use SQL-to-SQO curve
        COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0) + 
        (COALESCE(f.predicted_value, 0) - COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0)) * 
        COALESCE(
          (SELECT MAX(cumulative_pct) 
           FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_conversion_timing_curves`
           WHERE conversion_type = 'sql_to_sqo' 
             AND days_to_convert <= DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY)),
          DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) / 
          CAST(DATE_DIFF(DATE('2025-12-31'), CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) AS FLOAT64)
        )
      
      WHEN a.stage = 'joined' THEN
        -- Joined use SQO-to-Joined curve
        COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0) + 
        (COALESCE(f.predicted_value, 0) - COALESCE(c.current_actual, 0)) * 
        COALESCE(
          (SELECT MAX(cumulative_pct) 
           FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_conversion_timing_curves`
           WHERE conversion_type = 'sqo_to_joined' 
             AND days_to_convert <= DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY)),
          DATE_DIFF(a.date_day, CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) / 
          CAST(DATE_DIFF(DATE('2025-12-31'), CURRENT_DATE(), DAY) AS FLOAT64)
        )
    END
END AS predicted_value,
```

### Step 4: Test Curve-Based Predictions

```sql
-- QUERY 3C: Compare linear vs curve-based predictions
WITH linear_prediction AS (
  SELECT 
    date_day,
    SUM(sqls_predicted) as linear_sqls,
    SUM(sqos_predicted) as linear_sqos
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_timeseries_with_confidence_OLD`
  WHERE original_source = 'All'
    AND date_day BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  GROUP BY date_day
),
curve_prediction AS (
  SELECT 
    date_day,
    SUM(sqls_predicted) as curve_sqls,
    SUM(sqos_predicted) as curve_sqos
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_timeseries_with_confidence_NEW`
  WHERE original_source = 'All'
    AND date_day BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  GROUP BY date_day
)
SELECT
  l.date_day,
  l.linear_sqls,
  c.curve_sqls,
  ROUND(c.curve_sqls - l.linear_sqls, 1) as sql_difference,
  l.linear_sqos,
  c.curve_sqos,
  ROUND(c.curve_sqos - l.linear_sqos, 1) as sqo_difference
FROM linear_prediction l
JOIN curve_prediction c ON l.date_day = c.date_day
ORDER BY l.date_day;

-- You should see:
-- Early days: Curve predictions HIGHER (fast conversions)
-- Later days: Curve predictions LOWER (already converted)
-- End of quarter: Both converge to same total
```

### Why This Works
Think of it like plant growth - seedlings don't grow at a constant rate. They grow slowly at first, then rapidly, then plateau. Sales conversions follow a similar S-curve pattern. Using historical patterns gives much better short-term predictions.

**Expected Accuracy Improvement:** 5-10% reduction in prediction error, especially in final 2 weeks

---

## Enhancement #4: Pipeline Coverage Metrics with Velocity {#enhancement4}

### What This Fixes
**Current Problem:** Old opportunities convert differently than fresh ones. A 60-day-old MQL has different conversion probability than a 5-day-old MQL.

**Impact:** Over-predicting from stale pipeline, under-predicting from fresh pipeline.

### Step 1: Create Pipeline Age Analysis

```sql
-- CREATE NEW VIEW: vw_pipeline_velocity
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_pipeline_velocity` AS
WITH aged_pipeline AS (
  SELECT
    Full_prospect_id__c,
    Full_Opportunity_ID__c,
    Channel_Grouping_Name,
    Original_source,
    
    -- Calculate age in each stage
    CASE 
      WHEN is_mql = 1 AND is_sql = 0 THEN
        DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), DATE(mql_stage_entered_ts), DAY)
      ELSE NULL
    END as days_as_mql,
    
    CASE 
      WHEN is_sql = 1 AND is_sqo IS NULL THEN
        DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), DATE(converted_date_raw), DAY)
      ELSE NULL
    END as days_as_sql,
    
    CASE 
      WHEN is_sqo = 1 AND is_joined = 0 THEN
        DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), DATE(Date_Became_SQO__c), DAY)
      ELSE NULL

```

### Step 2: Test Pipeline Velocity

```sql
-- QUERY 4A: See how conversion rates decay with age
SELECT 
  conversion_type,
  age_bucket,
  converted,
  total,
  ROUND(conversion_rate * 100, 1) as conversion_rate_pct,
  REPEAT('█', CAST(conversion_rate * 100 AS INT64)) as visual_rate
FROM historical_rates_by_age
ORDER BY 
  conversion_type,
  CASE age_bucket
    WHEN '0-7 days' THEN 1
    WHEN '8-14 days' THEN 2
    WHEN '15-30 days' THEN 3
    WHEN '31-60 days' THEN 4
    ELSE 5
  END;

-- Expected pattern:
-- Age Bucket   | Rate | Visual
-- 0-7 days    | 65%  | ████████████████████████████████
-- 8-14 days   | 45%  | ██████████████████████
-- 15-30 days  | 25%  | ████████████
-- 31-60 days  | 10%  | █████
-- 60+ days    | 3%   | █
```

### Step 3: Update vw_forecast_vs_actuals Future_Conversions

**Replace the simple open pipeline counts with age-weighted predictions:**

```sql
-- OLD CODE (simplified)
Future_Conversions AS (
  SELECT
    -- Simple multiplication
    (COALESCE(p.open_mqls, 0) * COALESCE(r.mql_to_sql_rate, 0)) AS future_sqls,
```

**NEW CODE with age weighting:**

```sql
-- NEW CODE - Age-weighted conversions
Future_Conversions AS (
  SELECT
    COALESCE(p.channel_grouping_name, r.channel_grouping_name) AS channel_grouping_name,
    COALESCE(p.original_source, r.original_source) AS original_source,
    
    -- Age-weighted MQL conversions
    COALESCE(
      (SELECT SUM(age_adjusted_conversion_probability)
       FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_pipeline_velocity` v
       WHERE v.is_open_mql = 1
         AND v.Channel_Grouping_Name = COALESCE(p.channel_grouping_name, r.channel_grouping_name)
         AND v.Original_source = COALESCE(p.original_source, r.original_source)),
      p.open_mqls * COALESCE(r.mql_to_sql_rate, 0)  -- Fallback to simple rate
    ) AS future_sqls_from_mqls,
    
    -- Similar for SQLs and SQOs...
```

### Step 4: Final Validation

```sql
-- QUERY 4B: Compare simple vs age-weighted predictions
WITH simple_prediction AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(predicted_value) as simple_total
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_vs_actuals_OLD`
  WHERE stage = 'sqos'
),
weighted_prediction AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(predicted_value) as weighted_total
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_vs_actuals_NEW`
  WHERE stage = 'sqos'
)
SELECT
  s.simple_total,
  w.weighted_total,
  ROUND(w.weighted_total - s.simple_total, 1) as difference,
  ROUND((w.weighted_total - s.simple_total) / s.simple_total * 100, 1) as pct_change
FROM simple_prediction s
CROSS JOIN weighted_prediction w;

-- If you have lots of old pipeline, weighted should be 10-20% LOWER
```

### Why This Works
It's like fruit ripening - a fresh apple has high probability of ripening perfectly. An apple that's been sitting for 60 days probably won't ripen well anymore. Same with sales opportunities - fresh ones convert better than stale ones.

**Expected Accuracy Improvement:** 2-5% reduction in prediction error

## Final Integration Testing {#final-testing}

### Run Complete System Test

After implementing all changes, run this comprehensive test:

```sql
-- FINAL TEST: Full system validation
WITH improvements AS (
  SELECT
    'Re-engagements Included' as enhancement,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN opportunity_type = 'Re-engagement' THEN Full_Opportunity_ID__c END) as impact_count,
    'Found and including win-back opportunities' as status
  FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2_NEW`
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT
    'Team Size Adjusted' as enhancement,
    CAST(ROUND((SELECT team_size_ratio FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_team_size_tracking` WHERE date_day = CURRENT_DATE()) * 100, 0) AS INT64) as impact_count,
    'Forecast adjusted to ' || CAST(ROUND((SELECT team_size_ratio FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_team_size_tracking` WHERE date_day = CURRENT_DATE()) * 100, 0) AS STRING) || '% of original' as status
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT
    'Timing Curves Applied' as enhancement,
    (SELECT CAST(AVG(days_50th_percentile) AS INT64) FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_conversion_timing_curves`) as impact_count,
    'Using historical conversion timing patterns' as status
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT
    'Pipeline Velocity' as enhancement,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Full_prospect_id__c) FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_pipeline_velocity` WHERE days_as_mql > 30) as impact_count,
    'Aging adjustments for stale pipeline' as status
)
SELECT * FROM improvements;
```

### Dashboard Deployment Checklist

Before updating Looker Studio:

- [ ] All test queries return expected results
- [ ] No NULL values in critical calculations
- [ ] Prediction values are within reasonable bounds (not negative, not 10x forecast)
- [ ] Historical data (before Oct 2025) unchanged
- [ ] Team size ratio between 0.5 and 1.5
- [ ] Timing curves show expected S-curve shape
- [ ] Re-engagements appear in all downstream views

### Expected Total Improvement

With all four enhancements:
- **Re-engagements:** 10-20% error reduction
- **Team sizing:** 5-15% error reduction  
- **Timing curves:** 5-10% error reduction
- **Pipeline velocity:** 2-5% error reduction

**Total Expected Improvement:** 25-40% reduction in prediction error

This means if your current predictions are off by ±20%, they should be within ±12-15% after these changes.

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. All views have `_OLD` suffix backups
2. To rollback: 
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_vs_actuals` AS
SELECT * FROM `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_forecast_vs_actuals_OLD`;
```
3. Investigate issue using test queries
4. Fix and redeploy

---

## Summary

These four enhancements work together:
- **Re-engagements** ensure you're counting everything
- **Team sizing** adjusts expectations to reality
- **Timing curves** predict when conversions happen
- **Pipeline velocity** accounts for aging opportunities

Think of it like improving a wildlife population model:
1. Count ALL the animals (including ones that migrated back)
2. Adjust for your actual research team size
3. Use breeding season patterns instead of assuming uniform reproduction
4. Account for age-related fertility rates

Together, these changes transform your forecasting from "educated guess" to "surprisingly accurate prediction."
